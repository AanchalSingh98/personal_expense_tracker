# Personal Expense Tracker

This is my personal project to track expenses, visualize spending, and manage my budget. Out of the three projects I could choose from, I picked this one because it matched my core subjects — Data Science and Machine Learning. What started as a simple idea grew into a working Python app, and the journey taught me a lot along the way.

## My Journey

I decided to work on this project because I noticed I often lost track of my expenses. Out of the three options, this one felt closest to my interests in Data Science and ML.  

Before jumping into coding, I spent some time researching platforms where I could host the app, like Hugging Face and a few others. I also had to learn a bit about the libraries I would need, like `matplotlib` for charts and basic file operations in Python. This learning phase was important before I even wrote my first line of code.  

I had tried hosting a project on Hugging Face once before and failed, but I decided to try again with this one. With step-by-step guidance from ChatGPT, I was able to successfully push the project to both GitHub and Hugging Face. It was challenging at first, but seeing it work online felt like a real achievement.  

Writing the code came with its own set of struggles. Planning the app structure, making the charts look right, and debugging errors required patience and persistence. Each problem I solved felt rewarding. By the end, I had a fully working app, a live deployment, and a deeper understanding of Python, data visualization, and deployment.

## What It Does

- Add, edit, and delete expenses  
- Categorize spending to see where money goes  
- Generate charts to visualize spending patterns  
- Track overall budget

## How I Built It

I used Python for the main code, `matplotlib` for charts, and basic file operations to save the data. It wasn’t always straightforward — sometimes the charts didn’t render correctly, or files caused errors. But figuring these issues out taught me a lot about debugging and organizing code effectively.

## Challenges I Faced

- Choosing the right project that matched my interests  
- Researching platforms for hosting the app  
- Learning the necessary libraries before starting coding  
- Planning the app structure and features  
- Debugging charts and file handling issues  
- Deploying the project online after a previous failed attempt  
- Pushing the project to GitHub and Hugging Face  

Even though these challenges were frustrating at times, each one taught me something new and helped me improve my skills.

## What I Learned

- Patience is important — not everything works on the first try  
- Debugging teaches more than just writing code  
- Planning features ahead makes development smoother  
- Hosting an app online is achievable even after previous failures  
- Guidance, like what I got from ChatGPT, can make tricky steps much easier

## Future Plans

- Add multi-user support so others can use it  
- Export reports (PDF/Excel) for better tracking  
- Add more charts and insights to understand spending better  
- Make a mobile-friendly version for easier access

This project is special to me because it’s not just about coding — it’s about choosing the right project, learning new tools, overcoming obstacles, and creating something I can actually use every day.
